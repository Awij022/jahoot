# Jahoot
A fanmade, Javascript clone of Kahoot.  
Jahoot is an alternative and singleplayer (clone) version of Kahoot.  
This program is in no way affiliated with Kahoot.  
  
You could do many things with this basic script, like creating quizzes (or mods*) for it. Post them here!  
It's made with JavaScript (v8) and is fully customizable (also open source!).  
Test it out in your browser console, or deploy it in your webpage!  
*the example mod is "fishing.js" if you wanted to know
